# Rankings Module for BrowserCMS
This is module for BrowserCMS, which allows users to rank pages. It includes the following features:

* Rank This Page - Users can use a control on a page that allows users to rank a page from 1-5.
* Highest Ranked Pages - Users can see a list of pages which have the highest rank.

This module is primarily for demo purposes, and currently does not have any 'voter fraud' detection to prevent multiple
votes. Ideally, this would need to be done client side, with a cookie, so as to keep pages cachable in the CMS.
